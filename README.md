I created a React project called "Movies" that fetches and displays a list of movies using an API. The API provides details about each movie, and users can search for movies by name. Below each movie, the release date is shown. Additionally, users can mark their favorite movies and add them to a favorites list for easy access.

write: 
       npm init -y
       npm install
       npm install react-scripts
       cd frontend
       npm run dev
